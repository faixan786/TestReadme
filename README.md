### CloudTDMS - Test Data Management Service
CloudTDMS is a test data management tool that lets you generate realistic synthetic data in real-time. Besides synthetic 
data generation, `CloudTDMS` can be used as a potential tool for data masking and obfuscation of production data.

### What is it for?
With `CloudTDMS` you can?
+ Generate Realistic Synthetic Data.
+ Generate Synthetic Data From Custom Seed File.
+ Identify Personally Identifiable Information (PII) In Data.
+ Anonymize PII In Data.
+ Mask Sensitive Data To Ensure Compliance & Security.
+ Encrypt Private Data.
+ Generate Synthetic Data In Real-Time.
+ Generate Data Profiling Reports.
+ Cloning and Seeding Databases.
+ Cloning and Seeding ServiceNow tables.

## How To Use?

### Synthetic Data Generation

Create a file with `.py` extension inside the `config` directory of `cloudtdms`. This file will serve as a configuration 
to generate synthetic data. `CloudTDMS` expects a python script with a `STREAM` variable of type dictionary containing key-value 
pairs of configuration attributes defining your data generation scheme. Below is a simple example configuration containing various
configuration attributes that are used to define the data generation process. You can find the details of all the configuration
attributes supported by this version of cloudtdms in the [Configuration Attributes](docs/configuration_script.md) section.

Here we shall quickly go through the example configuration below to get the idea of data generation script.  

**example configuration**
   
```python
STREAM = {
    "number": 1000,
    "title": 'synthetic_data',
    "header":"true",
    "quoting":"true",
    "frequency": "once",
    "completeness":"60%",
    "synthetic": [
        {"field_name": "fname", "type": "personal.first_name"},
        {"field_name": "lname", "type": "personal.last_name",},
        {"field_name": "sex", "type": "personal.gender"},
        {"field_name": "email", "type": "personal.email_address"},
        {"field_name": "country", "type": "location.country"},
        {"field_name": "city", "type": "location.city"},
    ],
    "output_schema": {
        "synthetic.fname": "first_name",
        "synthetic.lname": "surname",
        "synthetic.sex": "gender",
        "synthetic.email": "mailing",
        "synthetic.country": "nation",
    }
}
```
>**Note**: The output from the above configuration will be available in `cloudtdms/data/CloudTDMS/synthetic_data/` folder of `cloudtdms`

>**Note**: If you have installed `CloudTDMS` via INSTALL script than `cloudtdms` folder will be available at `/home/cloudtdms`

+ `number` defines the number of records to be generated, In this case, we ask `cloudtdms` to generate 1000 records
+ `title` defines the name of the generated file, In this case, the generated data file will be inside `data/CloudTDMS/synthetic_data` folder of 
          `cloudtdms` and it will be named as `synthetic_data_YYYY_MM_DDTHH_mm_ss.csv`.
+ `header` defines whether the column names are to be displayed in the `.csv` file or not. When the `header` is set to `True`, the column names are displayed in              the `.csv` file. Otherwise it will not be displayed. The default value is `True`. `header` is optional and is available only for `.csv`.
+ `quoting` defines whether the data in `csv` file is enclosed within double-quotes or not. When the `quoting` is set to `True`, the data is displayed within double-quotes. Otherwise not. The default value is `False`. `quoting` is optional and is available only for `.csv`.
+ `completeness` defines how much of the data should be present in each column of a file and how much should be empty. For example `completeness = "60%"` means `60%` of the data are present in each column and `40%` of data in each column are filled with none. The default value for `completeness` is `100%`. 
+ `frequency` defines how often data should be generated, It takes a cron value such as `once`, `hourly`, `daily`, `monthly` etc.
+ `synthetic` defines the temporary logical schema of the synthetic data to be generated, each entry corresponds to a specific data generator defined in `CloudTDMS`. Here 
           the list contains six entries, means output synthetic data will have six columns with names `fname`, `lname`, `sex`, `email`
           `country`, `city`. The values for each column will be generated by a generator function defined in the `type` attribute
           of the list entry. that means value for `fname` will be generated by **`first_name`** generator function from the 
           **`personal`** provider, similarly, the value for `country` will be generated by **`country`** generator function from the
           **`location`** provider. A list of all the **providers** and available generators can be found in the [Providers](docs/providers.md) section
+ `output_schema` this attribute is used to specify the schema of the output. While `synthetic` attribute defines what data is to be generated, 
                  `output_schema` specifies what must be outputted. You may define 6 columns to be generated using `synthetic` attribute but
                  you may only output 5 columns using `output_schema`. This attribute can also be used to rename your generated columns, The renaming
                  process comes handy when you are fetching data from different sources. 
                  
Please refer [Configuration](docs/configuration_script.md) section for more details about various attributes that can be used
to build you configuration script.                                    
                   
### Data Profiling

In order to generate profiling reports for your data, you simply need to place your `CSV` data file inside the `profiling-data`
directory of the project. `CloudTDMS` will stage the data for profiling and generate reports inside the `profiling_reports`
directory. Please refer [Data Profiling](docs/data_profiling.md) section for details about the types of reports generated.

>Note : profiling reports are generated for CSV data only, CloudTDMS supports CSV files only in current version

### Data Masking

With `CloudTDMS` you can perform various data masking operations besides generating synthetic data. You can:

+ Anonymize sensitive data with synthetic data
+ Encrypt data with available encryption techniques
+ Perform masking using pseudo characters
+ Shuffle data
+ Perform nullying and deletion operations

Please refer [Data Masking](docs/data_masking.md) section for details about the usage and different masking operations available.
